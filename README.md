This project provides a cost-effective solution for Pakistani farmers to assess soil quality and receive fertilizer recommendations using a mobile application. Traditionally, soil testing requires laboratory analysis, which is expensive and time-consuming. To address this, we collected 1,064 soil images with laboratory-tested labels and trained multiple machine learning models including ANN, CNN, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Support Vector Regression to predict key soil nutrients. The best-performing model was deployed in the mobile app for real-time soil analysis, complemented by an NPK soil sensor to enhance accuracy. This approach enables farmers to make informed decisions, improving crop yield and promoting sustainable agriculture.
