# Mobile-Based Soil Quality Assessment Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project provides a cost-effective solution for Pakistani farmers to assess soil quality and receive fertilizer recommendations using a mobile application. Traditionally, soil testing requires laboratory analysis, which is expensive and time-consuming. To address this, we collected 1,064 soil images with laboratory-tested labels and trained multiple machine learning models—including ANN, CNN, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Support Vector Regression—to predict key soil nutrients. The best-performing model was deployed in the mobile app for real-time soil analysis, complemented by an NPK soil sensor to enhance accuracy. This approach enables farmers to make informed decisions, improving crop yield and promoting sustainable agriculture.

## Features
- Mobile application for soil quality assessment
- Predicts soil nutrients (NPK values) from smartphone images
- Recommends appropriate fertilizers based on analysis
- Uses machine learning models for nutrient prediction
- Supports NPK soil sensor integration for improved accuracy
- User-friendly interface for farmers with minimal technical knowledge
